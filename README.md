<h2>Legend tells of a legendary programmer whose coding skills were the stuff of the legend.</h2>
<p>
  Mr. <b>Jerry</b> is indeed a talented developer. When writing code every line is related and it's usually difficult to make it run after removal of several lines. But he did it and he doesn't care about it! How amazing!

  He would say: "<i>There is no charge for awesomeness or attractiveness.</i>"

  Look at <b>Tom</b>. He is so shocked and desparate that he will never ever be able to surpass Mr. Jerry, or get to the same level. Bless Tom.

  One day if Jerry become a CEO and lead the team, I am sure his team will do great things to make the world a better place.
